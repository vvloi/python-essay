# Frontend (React + Tailwind)

This folder contains a Vite + React frontend built to work with the FastAPI backend.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Run development server

   npm run dev

3. Build for production

   npm run build

The production build will output to `frontend/dist`. The backend will automatically serve `frontend/dist` when it exists.

TailwindCSS is configured; the entry CSS is at `src/index.css`.
